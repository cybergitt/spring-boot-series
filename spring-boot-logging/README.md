# Spring Boot Logging

This repository contains basic Spring Boot logging practices with SLF4J as an abstraction layer and Logback as the default logging implementation, advanced techniques like AOP and MDC, and performance optimization strategies. We also implement the use of the Log4j2 library without significantly changing the underlying application code.
